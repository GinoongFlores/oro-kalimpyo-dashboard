## How to make a pull request 
Ex: I want to push some changes to `christian-branch` from my branch called `jaycon-branch`
1. I will add my local changes to my local branch. But first, make sure we are on the right branch by `git switch jaycon-branch`. 
Then, `git add -A` to add all changes.
2. Commit the changes by `git commit -m "semantic message here"`
3. Push the changes to the remote (to our GitHub repo) by `git push`
<hr/>

4. Go to the repo link. Make sure you're on the `jaycon-branch` and click the `open pull request`

5. You will be directed to this page. Check if your `base` branch is `christian-branch` it must not the `main` branch.
  <br/> Write meaningful or semantic comments about your changes. Then, click `create pull request`

6. The owner of the `christian-branch` will receive the pull request notification and will merge it after review.
